What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git hidden directory is added and thus the files are being tracked. Without it we can't
really do anything because Git does not know that we want to track the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It different in the sense it "marks" the files that are about to be comitted and allow us more control over
what is going to be comitted since we don't necessarily want all the files in the working directory to be
comitted in each commit, but just the ones that represent a logical unit.
