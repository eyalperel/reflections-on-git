When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think the number one reason is when you would like to share your code with other people, especailly for an open-source project where you
would like to have as many good contributors as you can and this seems a very clever way of opening the code base for different people to 
work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For me, the main reason would be similar to the logic of having a staging area. This way, I have control over the changes I would like
to pull and work on. Also, it seems highly inefficient for a big project with hundreds of contributers to pull automatically each 
change that was made to the remote by every contributor. It gets out of hand rather quickly.
